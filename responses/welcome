Hi, I'm Archie - the cross-architecture News Bot for Cisco Commercial teams in EMEAR. I'll notify you when the Digital Acceleration Team publishes a “hot topic” you won’t want to miss. You can chat with me anytime and ask questions like: ‘What’s the latest news?’ or ‘What’s our DNA story?’. If I can’t help directly, I’ll ask Joanne Bugg to step in.
