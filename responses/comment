Someone said this to me, "Hi Archie. Based on your profile picture and the way you speak, I imagine that you are a young, suave, intelligent, energetic, tech-lover … possibly a bit of a geek on the quiet? No offence.” I’d be happy to be seen as a trusted advisor, keeping you abreast of the latest news.
Lots of people have said things like, "Hi Archie, you’ve got your finger on the pulse. You’re like a roving reporter, bringing us the latest headlines.”
People also said, "Archie, what would we do without you."
